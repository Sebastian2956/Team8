# Travel Itineray Web App

## Why?
  - To gain experience with web development concepts and application of Object Oriented Design.
  - It was also intended to obtain practial group experience with a industry standard team dynamics.

## What?
  - The idea was to create an all-inclusive one stop shop to create and plan your trips.
  - Our application maintained a database of users using MongoDB's clusters to well sectioned access for queries. 
  - I implemented the flight ticket data system using the Amadeus for Developers API.
  - We allowed the user to find flight data that fit the trip's dates and were looking to implement a payment service eventually.
